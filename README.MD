# Living Squares Game: A Playground for Machine Learning Enthusiasts

Welcome to the Living Squares Game! This project is a simple, flexible, and open-ended Python 3.11 game that serves as a playground for machine learning enthusiasts, researchers, and coders. It's currently in its infancy, but its potential is vast. 

## Description

The Living Squares Game is a game of simple primitives. It's intentionally vague and flexible, allowing you to add, modify, and experiment with features as you see fit. The game's structure is designed to be easily understandable and modifiable, making it an ideal starting point for machine learning projects.

## Installation

To get started with the Living Squares Game, you'll need to have Python 3.11 installed on your machine. Once you have Python set up, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patterns-complexity/living-squares-game.git
```

Proceed then to install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And you're done!

## Usage

You can run the game by executing the `run.py` file:

```bash
python run.py
```

## Tips and Ideas

While the Living Squares Game is intentionally simple, there are countless ways you can expand upon it. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

- Implement a new game mechanic and see how it affects the gameplay.
- Use the game as a testing ground for a new machine learning algorithm.
- Modify the game's rules to create a completely new game.
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the game more interactive.

Remember, the sky's the limit! This project is all about exploration and experimentation, so don't be afraid to think outside the box.

## Final Words

This project is not an enterprise-level project. It's a humble, flexible playground for anyone interested in machine learning and coding. We hope it serves as a useful starting point for your projects and experiments. Happy coding!
